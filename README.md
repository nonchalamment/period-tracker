## What is this?
Period Tracker is a simple MEN Stack app with Google OAuth to keep track of your periods as well as the levels of flow, pain, and mood for each day of your period. Each user's information is kept private -- you can't see or access someone else's records!

## How do I use this?
First log in with your Google account, then click on New Period to get started with trackin'! Once you've added a period, click on View Periods then Details to view information about that particular period. From the detail view, you can add new information about each day of your period.

## Next Steps
I want to figure out a graphical representation of the date ranges. Working with dates in JavaScript has turned out to be a pain, so it would also be good to figure out a good library to use to make date calculations easier.
